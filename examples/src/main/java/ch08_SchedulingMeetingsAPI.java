     * PREREQUISITE: unsafe functions that we'll use to simulate external API calls
     *
     * They have *ApiCall suffix:
     * - call an external service to all current calendar entries for a given name.
     * - call an external service to create a new meeting in $name's calendar.
     *
     * These are not an example of FP code, but a simplistic simulation of how some an external API may behave.
     * Note that we can't change an external API and need to work with how it works (so no change in these functions!).
     * Note that we don't consider any security pitfalls her for the sake of a cleaner presentation.
     * Note that most likely this should return a raw JSON, not a List[Meeting], but it doesn't matter here, plus
     * we already know how to deal with parsing.
